    # Lab 01: Campaign Finance & Ideology Estimation with PCA

    In this lab you will explore campaign finance data from the 2024 election cycle
    and use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to estimate the political ideology
    of donors and recipients.

    The data comes from the [Database on Ideology, Money in Politics, and Elections
    (DIME)](https://data.stanford.edu/dime), compiled by Adam Bonica. We are working
    with a subset that includes donors who contributed to **8 or more** distinct
    candidates or committees.

    **What you'll do:**

    1. **Part A** — Explore donation patterns: who gives, who receives, and how
       contributions break down by party and industry.
    2. **Part B** — Estimate ideology scores using PCA on a donor × recipient
       contribution matrix, following a simplified version of Bonica's
       approach.

    **Key columns in the data:**

    | Column | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `bonica_cid` | Unique donor ID |
    | `bonica_rid` | Unique recipient ID |
    | `total_amount` | Total dollars from this donor to this recipient |
    | `contributor_type` | `I` = individual, `C` = committee |
    | `recipient_party` | `100` = Democrat, `200` = Republican |
    | `recipient_type` | `CAND` = candidate, `COMM` = committee |
    | `seat` | Office sought (e.g. `federal:house`, `federal:senate`) |
    | `contributor_occupation` | Self-reported occupation |

    ## How to Complete Exercises

    Each exercise contains placeholder code marked with `...` that you need to replace with your solution. The exercises use `mo.stop()` to pause execution until you complete each step.

    **To complete an exercise:**

    1. Replace the `...` placeholder with your code
    2. Run the cell — the `mo.stop()` checks automatically pass once `...` is replaced with a real value, so you don't need to delete anything

    For example, if you see:

    ```python
    my_result = ...  # YOUR CODE

    mo.stop(
        my_result is ...,
        mo.md("⚠️ Complete this step...")
    )
    ```

    Just replace the `...` with your code:

    ```python
    my_result = some_data.filter(pl.col("x") > 0)  # Your actual code

    mo.stop(
        my_result is ...,       # ← this check now passes automatically
        mo.md("⚠️ Complete this step...")
    )
    ```

    > **Tip:** Work through each step sequentially. The `mo.stop()` pattern ensures you get feedback at each stage before moving on.

    ## Part B: Estimating Ideology with PCA

    We now turn to the main analytical goal: **recovering an ideological
    dimension** from campaign-finance data.

    ### Intuition

    Donors who give to the same candidates probably share similar political
    views. The **contributor x candidate matrix** encodes this information:
    each row is a donor, each column is a candidate, and each cell records
    whether that donor contributed to that candidate.

    We use **binary** (gave / didn't give) rather than dollar amounts. This
    focuses on the *pattern* of who gives to whom rather than how much
    they give - a billionaire and a retiree who support the same set of
    candidates carry the same ideological signal.

    ### Normalizing the matrix

    Even in a binary matrix, some donors give to many candidates (they're
    prolific) and some candidates receive from many donors (they're popular).
    We need to remove this variation so that PCA captures ideology, not
    activity level.

    The idea: compare each cell to what we'd **expect** if donors and
    candidates were matched at random (given their overall activity levels).
    Cells that are higher than expected reveal genuine affinity; cells that
    are lower reveal avoidance.

    Concretely:

    1. Divide every cell by the grand total to get proportions: $P = X / N$
    2. Compute row totals $r$ and column totals $c$ of the proportion matrix.
    3. The **expected** value for cell $(i,j)$ under independence is
       $E_{ij} = r_i \times c_j$.
    4. The **standardized residual** measures how far each cell deviates
       from what we'd expect, scaled by that expectation:

    $$K_{ij} = \frac{P_{ij} - E_{ij}}{\sqrt{r_i \times c_j}}$$

    This removes variation from donor prolificness and candidate popularity,
    leaving the *pattern* of who gives to whom - which is where ideology
    lives. PCA on $K$ should recover the liberal-conservative axis as PC1.

    ### Exercise 6: Recipient ideology scores

    #### Analytical Goal

    Does PC1 separate Democrats from Republicans? Which end is liberal
    and which is conservative? Build a chart of recipient ideology
    scores to find out.

    #### Background

    We can score each recipient by averaging the PC1 scores of their
    donors. A candidate whose donors are mostly liberal will get a
    score on the liberal end; a candidate whose donors are mostly
    conservative will land on the other side. Candidates who attract
    donors from both parties end up near zero.

    **Tasks:**

    1. Compute each recipient's ideology score (provided below).
    2. Join with `recipients_meta` to get names and parties. Add a readable
       `party` column mapping `"100"` to `"Democrat"` and `"200"` to `"Republican"`.
    3. Take a random sample of ~50 recipients (use `.sample(50)`).
    4. Create a dot chart (use `mark_circle()`) showing these recipients,
       with ideology score on x and recipient name on y, colored by party.

    ### Exercise 7: Donor ideology distributions

    *Hints:*

    - Use `transform_density("pc1_score", as_=["pc1_score", "density"], groupby=["industry"])`
      to compute densities, then `mark_area()`.
    - Facet with `row=alt.Row("industry:N", ...)` so each industry gets its own row.
    - To order by mean ideology, precompute a sorted list of industry names
      and pass it to `sort=` in `alt.Row()`.

    - Which industries are most polarized (wide spread)?
    - Which industries lean most liberal or conservative?

    ## Wrap-up

    In this lab you:

    1. **Explored** campaign finance data - who gives, who receives, and how
       donation flows differ by party and industry.
    2. **Normalized** a donor x recipient matrix to remove effects of donor
       prolificness and recipient popularity.
    3. **Ran PCA** on the normalized matrix to recover an ideological dimension.
    4. **Interpreted** the results by examining recipient loadings (which
       separate Democrats from Republicans) and donor ideology distributions
       (which reveal polarization patterns across industries).

    This is a simplified version of the method in:
