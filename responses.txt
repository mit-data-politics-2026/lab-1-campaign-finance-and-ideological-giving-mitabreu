Who is MIT's biggest political donor? Were you surprised?
    - Ronald Rivest is MIT's largest political donor. I was not surprised. I had never heard of Ronald Rivest.

Question: Which party receives a larger share of its money from out-of-state donors? What does that tell you about the "nationalization" of campaign finance?
    - The republican party receives a slightly larger share of its money from out-of-state-donors.
    The fact that so much of the shares for both parties come from out-of-state donors tells me capaign finance is extremely natonalized.

Question: Which industries lean most Democratic? Most Republican? What might explain these patterns?
    - Education, Science, and Legal lean the most Democratic. This makes sense because those in 
    higher education typically lean Democratic. The most Republican leaning donors are retirees and
    those in Business/Administration this could be explained as Republican policies typically benefit businesses
    and retirees in a position to donate money to politicans would benefit from tax cuts.


Summarize your findings. What patterns did you find and what might explain them?
    - Besides candidates the occupations that donate the most money on average are chairman by far. This might be due to 
    lobbying they may be doing for their comittee/company to get politicans that are likely to pass beneficial polices
    in office.

In your own words, what does this normalization accomplish? Why do we need to remove the effects of donor prolificness and candidate popularity before running PCA?
    - The normalization allows us to remove the effects of donors donating to more candidates then other donors and the unusual popularity of certain candidates.
    We need to remove these effects to ensure we capture the aspect of the data we actually care about: what candidates donors give to.

Why might PC1 dominate so strongly in campaign finance data? What does the gap between PC1 and PC2 tell us about the structure of American political donations?
    - This is likely because PC1 represents party. The gap between PC1 and PC2 tells us that American donators are very loyal to their party and have 
    easily predictable donation patterns.
